# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction with FastAPI & Machine Learning  

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9%2B-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)  
[![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-Framework-green)](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)  
[![Scikit-Learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/ML-ScikitLearn-orange)](https://scikit-learn.org/)  

🚀 A **Machine Learning web app** built using **FastAPI** that predicts housing prices in California based on demographic and geographical features.  
This project demonstrates **end-to-end ML deployment** — from training the model to serving predictions via an interactive API and HTML interface.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 📊 Trained on **California Housing Dataset**  
- 🤖 **Linear Regression model** with preprocessing scaler  
- ⚡ **FastAPI backend** for high-performance ML inference  
- 🌍 **Interactive HTML page** for user-friendly input  
- 📜 **Swagger UI docs** for API testing (`/docs`)  
- 📦 Includes saved model (`linear_regression_model.pkl`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`)
